# GeneticAlgorithmPathFinder
This project aims at developing a console-based Genetic Algorithm for solving optimization problems using a crossover method known as Partially Matched Crossover (PMX). The main objective is finding the shortest path in a given matrix.

The main features of the project are:

-The use of a Genetic Algorithm: using an algorithm that simulates natural selection to evolve a solution over successive generations

-Crossover Method: PMX is used to combine two parent solutions (paths) to produce an offspring that inherit characteristics from both parents

-Population Management: Threads are used to manage and evolve a population of solutions concurrently, which enhances performance by allowing parallel processing

-File Reading: The matrix that represents distances or costs is read from a file
